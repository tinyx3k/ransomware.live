Since then we have grown to become one of the leading law firms in the East Midlands with offices in Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, providing support and advice to businesses, individuals and families with their legal and investment needs.\nAt Nelsons, we look to empower our clients, to give them a voice, fight for them, help them seek justice and steer them through the complex legal issues they face. The desire to push ourselves forwards to better serve our clients has been a constant throughout our evolution.\nWe have always looked to challenge the traditional norms often associated with the legal industry. In 2010, we were one of the first law firms in the region to become a Limited company. Then in 2014, we were granted Alternative Business Structure (ABS) status which allows our employees who aren’t solicitors – such as those in the management, conveyancing and investment management teams – to become Partners.\n","message":"- Internal Company Data (Employees personal data, CV's, DL's, ID's, SSN's, Financial reports, Accounting data, Loans data, Case files, Agreements and much more);\n- Clients documentation (DL's, ID's, SSN's, Financial data, Credit cards information, Loans data, Case files, Agreements and much more);\n- Complete network map including credentials for local and remote services;\n- And more…","logo":{"id":"/article-attachment/bc8d9e5b-0341-450e-b81a-58ab6c1778df/5ff3aee3-0db3-463a-822f-09964f92d188","title":"redacted","dt":1658273775008},"attachments":[{"id":"/article-attachment/bc8d9e5b-0341-450e-b81a-58ab6c1778df/dc55109b-86b4-4248-88c3-5927489db36e","title":"redacted","dt":1658273881153},{"id":"/article-attachment/bc8d9e5b-0341-450e-b81a-58ab6c1778df/63e0372c-11ac-4f18-b0af-3b829eea4043","title":"redacted","dt":1658273899387},{"id":"/article-attachment/bc8d9e5b-0341-450e-b81a-58ab6c1778df/63f9f657-4d30-4779-8c66-9b0051da1068","title":"redacted","dt":1658273917582},{"id":"/article-attachment/bc8d9e5b-0341-450e-b81a-58ab6c1778df/2c194e21-9536-4cb0-9259-bbc3f0109e43","title":"redacted","dt":1658273935123},{"id":"/article-attachment/bc8d9e5b-0341-450e-b81a-58ab6c1778df/7c4560fd-d5fc-44f4-b6d3-a07cc1599be2","title":"redacted","dt":1658273953196}],"fileHosts":[]},"createdDt":1658273753474},{"id":"37995170-3476-4e19-853c-ef4ebba45dce","title":"Reed Pope Law","previewContent":"blank","content":null,"publication":{"url":"https://www.reedpope.ca/","country":"unknown","description":"Reed Pope Business Lawyers is a leading business law firm based in Victoria, British Columbia.
