HELLO dear Management of [snip]

If you are reading this message, it means that:
- your network infrastructure has been compromised,
- critical data was leaked,
- files are encrypted,
- backups are deleted

------------------------------------------------------

by D A R K A N G E L S T E A M

The best and only thing you can do is to contact us
to settle the matter before any losses occurs.

1. THE FOLLOWING IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN

1.1 EDITING FILES ON HDD.
Renaming, copying or moving any files
could DAMAGE the cipher and
decryption will be impossible.

1.2 USING THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE.
Trying to recover with any software
can also break the cipher and
file recovery will become a problem.

1.3 SHUTDOWN OR RESTART THE PC.
Boot and recovery errors can also damage the cipher.
Sorry about that, but doing so is entirely at your own risk.

1.4 HIRING THE EUROPOL AND OTHERS
Cooperating with the EUROPOL, INTERPOL and so on
and involving their officers in negotiations
will end our communication with you
and we will share all the leaked data for free.
