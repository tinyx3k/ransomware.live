This message contains an information how to fix the troubles you've got with your network.<br><br>

Files on the workstations in your network were encrypted and any your attempt to change, decrypt or rename them could destroy the content.<br>
The only way to get files back is a decryption with Key, provided by the Quantum Locker.<br><br>

During the period your network was under our control, we downloaded a huge volume of information.<br>
Now it is stored on our servers with high-secure access. This information contains a lot of sensitive, private and personal data.<br>
Publishing of such data will cause serious consequences and even business disruption.<br><br>

It's not a threat, on the contrary - it's a manual how to get a way out.<br>
Quantum team doesn't aim to damage your company, our goals are only financial.<br><br>

After a payment you'll get network decryption, full destruction of downloaded data, information about your network vulnerabilities and penetration points.<br>
If you decide not to negotiate, in 48 hours the fact of the attack and all your information will be posted on our site and will be promoted among dozens of cyber forums, news agencies, websites etc.<br><br>
