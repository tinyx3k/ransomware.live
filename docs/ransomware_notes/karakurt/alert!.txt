Ok, you are reading this - so it means that we have your attention.
Here's the deal :
1. We breached your internal network and took control over all of your systems.
2. We analyzed and located each piece of more-or-less important files while spending weeks inside.
3. We exfiltrated anything we wanted (the total size of taken data is 1000 (!!!) GB BUT it is very sensitive and very confidential. Our team attacked you pointwise)



You can find full listing of taken files in attached file.



FAQ:
- Who the hell are you?
- The Karakurt Team. Pretty skilled hackers I guess.



- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!??
- Our motivation is purely financial.



- We are going to report this to law enforcement.
- You surely can, but be ready that they will confiscate most of your IT infrastructure, and even if you later change your mind and decide to pay - they will not let you.



- Who else already knows about the breach?
- Me and You who received the same message the same way. Nobody else. For now.



- What if I tell you that I do not care and I am going to ignore this incident.
- That's a very bad choice. If you will not contact us in a timely manner (by 07.08.2022) we will start notifying your employees, clients, partners, subcontractors and any other persons that should know how you treat your own corporate secrets and theirs.



- What if I will not contact you even after it?
- Then we shall move forward and start contacting your business competitors and list of anonymous inside traders we deal with, to find out if they are going to pay us for your data. When the list of the people who is interested in such data is formed - the closed online auction starts.



- Nobody will buy what you took! I do not believe you!
- If the auction fails - we will just leak everything online, making sure that this leak goes straight to the press. We will make sure that your business will bleed by using any power we have in our possession, both social and technical.



- What happens if I pay?
- Nothing bad will happen.
We will remove everything we took from your network and leave you be.
We will provide confirmation that the data is deleted.
We will help you to close technical vulnerabilities you have and provide some insight on how to avoid such incidents if some other perpetrator is interested in you.
We will never tell anybody about it.



- We understand. We are ready to move forward.
- You will find the Access Code at the end of this file, you will need this one to get in contact with us for further instructions
