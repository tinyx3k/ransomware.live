Your network has been penetrated.

All files on each host in the network have been encrypted with a strong algorythm.

Backups were either encrypted or deleted or backup disks were formatted.
Shadow copies also removed, so F8 or any other methods may damage encrypted data but not recover.

We exclusively have decryption software for your situation
No decryption software is available in the public.

	DO NOT RESET OR SHUTDOWN - files may be damaged.
	DO NOT RENAME OR MOVE the encrypted and readme files.
	DO NOT DELETE readme files.
	DO NOT use any recovery software with restoring files overwriting encrypted.
	This may lead to the impossibility of recovery of the certain files.
