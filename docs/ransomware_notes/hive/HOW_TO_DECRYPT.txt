Follow the guidelines below to avoid losing your data:

 - Do not delete or reinstall VMs. There will be nothing to decrypt.
 - Do not modify, rename or delete *.key files. Your data will be 
   undecryptable.
 - Do not modify or rename encrypted files. You will lose them.
 - Do not report to the Police, FBI, etc. They don't care about your business.
   They simply won't allow you to pay. As a result you will lose everything.
 - Do not hire a recovery company. They can't decrypt without the key. 
   They also don't care about your business. They believe that they are 
   good negotiators, but it is not. They usually fail. So speak for yourself.
 - Do not reject to purchase. Exfiltrated files will be publicly disclosed.
