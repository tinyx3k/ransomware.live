Years later, as fate would have it, both Schatko and McGivern were working at what was then known as Macomb Pipe &amp; Supply to help pay for college tuition. Although they knew they wanted to become business owners, they also knew how important warehouse operations were to the success of a company so they learned all they could. They started by sweeping floors, packing orders, familiarizing themselves with the products and working the sales counter.
